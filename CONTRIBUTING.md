# Contributing to Hystrix-Box
👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍  
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## How Can I Contribute?
- Reporting a bug

## Reporting a bug 🐛
Open a new issue using the bug report [template](https://github.com/zomry1/Hystrix-Box/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)

### We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

## Code contribute method
1. 🚦 Open new issue and get the green light to start working on the code (This is an important stage, in order to avoid unnecessary work).
2. 🍴 Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev` (Give it a self-explain name).
3. 💬 Commit your code once in a while to help other developers understand you work (Use good commit messages).
* We are using emojis to define commits using [this guide](https://github.com/dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji)
4. 📄 If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. 📖 If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
6. ✅ Ensure the test suite passes.
7. 🔝 Issue that pull request! (And use the pull request template)
8. 💌 Get our sincere appreciation!

* steps 4,5 are optional, you can leave those to the maintainers, but update us about that.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
